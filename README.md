# NetworkHostTracking
Python network automation project.

Using Flask as the front end network host tracking project.

Some pointer still to be worked on.
1) Displaying the inventory file better.
2) Add inventory file related operation to flask ( add, delete, etc, devices)
3) A better way to gathering username and password for device login rather then saving it to inventory file.
